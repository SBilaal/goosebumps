A totally not useless Flutter package for randomly playing horror-themed sounds.

## Overview

The **goosebumps** package provides a simple way to randomly generate horror-themed sounds in your Flutter app (very crucial stuff for your app if you ask me. Absolutely not uselessðŸ™ƒ.). It also lets you control the frequency at which the audio clips are played and provides an option to disable the sound by shaking the device (nifty, that.ðŸ˜Œ).

## Requirements
On Android:
- Include the VIBRATE permission in AndroidManifest.xml:
    ```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE"/>
    ```

- Set `compileSDKVersion` to 33 in **android\app\build.gradle**.


## Usage

Import the **goosebumps** package:

```dart
import 'package:goosebumps/goosebumps.dart';
```

Initialize horror sounds generation:

```dart
await Horror.init();
```

This initializes the horror sounds generator with the default settings. The audio clips will be played at a very low frequency.

You can customize the frequency using the `Frequency` class. The smaller the frequency value, the fewer times the audio clip is played. The `Frequencies` class provides some predefined frequency constants:

* `Frequencies.veryLow`
* `Frequencies.low`
* `Frequencies.medium`
* `Frequencies.high`
* `Frequencies.veryHigh`

You can also pass a `Frequency` object to the `init()` method to set a custom frequency:

```dart
// That's really low by the way.
await Horror.init(frequency: Frequency(milliHertz: 2));
```

By default, shaking the device will toggle the sound generation on or off. When the device is shook, it vibrates for one second to indicate that it is disabled and half a second to indicate that it is enabled. 

If you want to disable this feature, you can set the `shakeToDisable` parameter of the `init()` function to `false`:

```dart
await Horror.init(shakeToDisable: false);
```

For an even better chance at staying hidden, you can use the below API instead of `Horror.init()`:
```dart
WidgetFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
```
It looks just like `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` from flutter. It even shows the same docs! And since `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` is alread called inside `Horror.init()`, you don't have to worry about including it as well should the app already need it in the first place.

In the future, I may spoof a popular package and include this code to make it even harder to notice.
